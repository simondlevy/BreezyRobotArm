This repository contains a Python library and simple use-case for controlling a multi-jointed robot arm using
an Arduino microcontoller.  By using standard Python (instead of C++ or MicroPython), the library allows 
you to import and use other powerful Python libraries like [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to add intelligent 
behaviors to your robot.

To get started, you should download and install [PyFirmata](https://github.com/tino/pyFirmata).
